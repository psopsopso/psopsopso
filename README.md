Hi, I'm Patrice, a former business major, CPA and Financial Controller, currently studying computer science. Currently, I am focused on learning everything that is related to web development and software engineering as a whole. My background in finance, accounting, and management has given me a unique perspective on how technology can be leveraged to solve real-world problems. As a future Full Stack Engineer, my goal is to work with cutting-edge technologies to develop innovative solutions that drive business value. I am eager to learn and grow in this profession, and I am actively seeking opportunities to achieve my career goals.
