As a former business major, CPA and Financial Controller with a passion for technology, I have just completed a Certificat en Informatique from Universit√© Laval and I am now excited to continue my education in this field by pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science in order to pivot my career into IT. 

My unique background as an accountant has equipped me with valuable skills in analysis, problem-solving, and attention to detail. Through the Certificat en Informatique program, I have gained a foundational understanding of programming, databases, and networking, and am eager to continue building on this knowledge.

With a deep interest in exploring the intersection between business and technology, I am excited to leverage my diverse skill set to contribute to innovative projects in IT. I am open to opportunities to collaborate and learn from other professionals in the field, and am committed to pursuing a fulfilling career in IT.
